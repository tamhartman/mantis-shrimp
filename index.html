        <p>The mantis shrimp is basically the greatest animal in the world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Living deep underwater, the mantis shrimp is rainbow for no apparent reason. 
            I don't know why it's rainbow - not like anyone's going to see anything down there. 
            <i>BUT</i> The mantis shrimp can see way more colors than you will ever be able to see. 
            They are also <i>UNBELIEVABLY STABBY.</i> No joke, a mantis shrimp can stab so fast
            that it actually boils the water around it. If you're looking for a pet, the 
            mantis shrimp is a horrible choice. They are not recommended for homes with children
            or curious pets. They also are known to break tanks and fingers, are aggressive even towards other mantis shrimp,
            and will totally ruin your day if you let them. That being said, mantis shrimp are <i>AMAZING!!!</i>
